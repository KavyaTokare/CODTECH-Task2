Project: Linear Regression on Housing Price

Objective
The objective of linear regression on house prices in machine learning is to develop a model that can predict the price of a house based on various input features (such as square footage, number of rooms, location, etc.). By finding the optimal linear relationship between these features and the target variable (price), the model helps estimate the price of new or unseen properties. This provides valuable insights for real estate pricing, enabling better decision-making for buyers, sellers, and agents.

Key activities 
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather housing data with relevant features (e.g., square footage, number of rooms) and clean it to handle any missing or inconsistent values.
2. Feature Selection: Choose the most impactful features that correlate strongly with the house prices to improve model performance.
3. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and test sets to enable the model to learn from one subset and be evaluated on another.
4. Model Training: Apply linear regression to the training data, allowing the model to determine the optimal coefficients for each feature.
5. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict house prices on the test data or new data samples.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess its accuracy and reliability in predicting prices.
